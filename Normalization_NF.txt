Database normalization, or simply normalization, is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Normalization is also the process of simplifying the design of a database so that it achieves the optimal structure.

The First normal form (1NF) sets basic rules for an organized database âˆ’

Define the data items required, because they become the columns in a table.

Place the related data items in a table.

Ensure that there are no repeating groups of data.

Ensure that there is a primary key.


2NF: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/second-normal-form.htm
meet all the rules for 1NF and there must be no partial dependences of any of the columns on the primary key. 
Meaning if composite primary key, all other columns should rely on all columns in composite keys


3NF: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/third-normal-form.htm
It is in second normal form.
All nonprimary fields are dependent on the primary key.
