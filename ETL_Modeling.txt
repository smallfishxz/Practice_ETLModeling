[edit]On Site

1. Streaming Movie Service ETL Odyssey - Data_Engineering/Interviews/Questions/MoviePlaybackETLOdyssey
2. Design a model that can capture Product Waterfalls
Examples:
User clicks on Composer, types out a message, attaches a photo, picks a location, hits submit
User installs the app, enters their phone number, picks a password, finds friends via contacts
Notification Jewel lights up, user clicks the jewel, user clicks a notification, user gives feedback (like/comment) on the item in the notification
The design should consider that there will be a variable number of levels
